(phase 1) - All non jump instructions
(phase 2) - Add jump instructions
(phase 3) - Add pseudo instructions (optional, But keep it in mind)

I need to:
Have a usable list of all instructions and their categorization
Have a list of pseudo instructions and their conversions
Have a list of register aliases
Have a proper control system to handle errors

Have a makefile
Have a test harness
Have a README
Have a report (latex obviously)

First (phase 1) Remove whitespace and comments
      (phase 2) scan all the code for Labels and note their positions, and also remove the labels as well

Next Read in instructions line by line and convert them to hexcode using the applicable lookup tables as well as validate the instructions

Next Exit gracefully

Todos:
Remove dead code. Improve names
Write report
Add test cases
Add pseudo instructions capabilities (optional)
